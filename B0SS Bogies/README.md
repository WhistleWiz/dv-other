# Important

Y25 and Y32 inspired bogies **for use in Derail Valley mods only**.

Model made by B0SS/Adrii_95.

# Usage

These prefabs are ready for use in Derail Valley, and already follow the correct bogie structure.

### CCL

After importing the package, you can just drag and drop under `BogieF`/`BogieR` in your custom CCL vehicle, and rename the instanced prefab `bogie_car`.

### Car Changer

After importing the package, you can link the prefabs directly to the bogie fields on any config. None of these bogies are powered. You'll need to add the ExtraBrakeRenderer scripts to the U32 disc brake meshes in the axles.
